                    <h6>About me:</h6>
                    <div><p>I&#39;m Justin. I&#39;ve been programming for many years. I&#39;m
self-taught. I dig talking because it provides me an excuse to dig
deeper into a topic, as well as a method of share my findings with
others.</p>
<p>As for formats, I&#39;m happy with a tour of code, if there&#39;s a
particular repo of mine that catches your eye, standard speaker +
slides or round table discussion things.</p>
<p>For topics, I&#39;m into a bunch of stuff, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>static analysis</li>
<li>writing testable code</li>
<li>playing with irc bots</li>
<li>application structure and architecture</li>
<li>technical paper discussion</li>
<li>computer science (and education thereof)</li>
<li>tooling as a general concept</li>
</ul>

                    <h6>About me:</h6>
                    <div><p>I&#39;m a Node engineer for New Relic who has contributed significantly to their
instrumentation for Node.js. I&#39;ve been using Node professionally since 2011,
co-ran one of the session tracks at NodeConf 2013, and have contributed some
 small pieces to Node core. My most significant public project aside from
 <a href="https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic">node-newrelic</a> is probably
 <a href="https://github.com/othiym23/node-continuation-local-storage">continuation-local storage</a>,
of which I am the primary maintainer. No server-side JavaScript is too gross
 for me to be interested in.</p>
<p>Node is a great platform but it can be scary to get started with, and it can
continue to be scary to plumb its depths. I&#39;m comfortable with Node&#39;s (and
    JavaScript&#39;s) many idiosyncracies and awkward design tradeoffs and really enjoy
helping other people get more comfortable as well. Having done all of free-form
talks with questions, formal presentations, and hands-on workshops, I enjoy all
three, although I do better when there are frequent opportunities for
questions.</p>
